    <h2>Adhum Miah</h2>
    <!--Email and Introductory Paragraph-->
    <h3><em>Email - adhum.miah19@mynorthampton.ac.uk</em></h3>
    <p>I am a beginner to web development as you may have already noticed, 
        but my skills are developing as time goes on. I am extremely enthusiastic 
        about furthering my knowledge and skillset for me to fulfil my aspirations 
        of becoming a high-end developer one day â€“ gain contacts in successful 
        businesses to all succeed.</p>
    <!--Experience Information Code-->
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>In terms of experience, the only sort of experience I have in web development would be the work 
        that I have done in university during my module work to this date, as I am a new individual to all this,
        as time progresses I hope to expand my skills and expertise to a much higher level and be an experienced
        person when it comes to developing. </p>
        <!--Interests Description-->
    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>I have a huge passion for cars, which may make me a petrolhead. 
       I like modifying cars to my own taste and changing them aesthetically as well as performance enhancing. 
       I have been very fond of cars since a young age, technological aspects of cars and all sorts! 
       I like playing sports such as foothall, table tennis, badminton and also playing pool as a hobby.</p>
