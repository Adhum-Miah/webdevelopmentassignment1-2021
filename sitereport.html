    <!--Paragraph For Site Report-->
    <p>My experience of learning the basics of web development, coding, design and debugging process has been okay so far
    with expected difficulties.As I am a beginner I expected to have difficulties which I most certainly did but did manage to make it look presentable somehow! 
    I liked the freedom of being able to select my own fonts and background image and the general layout of the site. 
    I made decisions in terms of the fonts and colouring to my own taste and the background image I liked as it was subtle and not too bright which I also liked. 
    I didn’t use any sites as a reference point, I just started to add features and then positioning things in way which suited my design styles 
    and that’s how I ended up with the site I have now!
    However, I had issues with creating the hamburger and linking it to my navigation bar but it is still responsive. I also had
    issues with creating the colums in order to have the necessary layout for the Portfolio, CV and Site Report Pages.
    I hope I am able to learn how to resolve these issues in order for me to be more successful in the next assignment</p>
    <p>The module experience, in all honesty was not the best (no issue with the lecturer) but mainly 
    due to the fact that I had a prolonged issued with my timetable so I missed a fair amount of the module unfortunately, 
    but I made sure to catch up in my own time as best as I could in order for me to have less difficulty with the assignment.
    As mentioned above, I did have a few issues which unfortunately I could not resolve but mistakes need to be made in order to learn
    from them. On the whole, I like the module and Thomas is a really nice guy and is good at his job which I appreciate. 
    Hopefully this lockdown ends so I and all the other students can get that proper web development experience 
    and make the most of our studies!</p>
