Please find my enclosed assignment. For some reason I am completely unaware of, I was unable to link my GitHub to my VSCODE due to there being 5000 commits and then when attempting to commit them it said something about being non-existent. I am not familiar with the works of VSCODE completely and it would more than likely need to be addressed by someone who knows the possible issue.
I have manually uploaded all my files and I have checked, the website works when clicking the link.
Many Thanks
